Project 1 - Search Project that involves pacman navigating a maze by using BFS, DFS, and A*. Pacman also solves corner and food probelms using heuristics.

Project 2 - Constraint Satisfaction Problem - Project that solves various CSP problems using techniques such as recursive backtracing, variable selection, value ordering, forward checking, maintain arc consistency, and pre-processing.

Project 3- Dynamic Bayesian Network - Project that involves pacman trying to eat ghosts using exact and approximate inferences using bayes net. Also uses joint particle filters to be able to track ghosts.
